>> fread returns how many items of size SIZE were read; try using it directly in a condition

open file (fopen) and check that is not null
need struct to hold 512 byte segments
variable to record # of JPEGS found, starting at 0
repeat until EOF reached (see hint above?)
    cycle through segments
        read 512 bytes into buffer
        if first four bytes match jpeg
            is this not the first JPEG found? (count variable != 0)
                close open outup file
            create file with sprintf
            write buffer into file
